# litAnalysis

This is meant to be a literature analysis project, in addition to being a project that is, in the immortal words of James Joyce, "Lit AF".

***Technologies used***

Tentative analysis shows that the collaborators on this project are familiar with completely different technologies, so the plan now is to use

1. Python with Tensorflow
2. R
3. Scala with Spark

We'll see which one we end up using.
